                        <div class="content">
							<p>Computer assisted learning (CAL) is any method of education in which computers are used in order to assist in learning. As technology continues to advance, computer assisted learning is becoming more and more prevalent in classrooms worldwide. CAL has the potential to increase productivity in the classroom as well as supplement the work of teachers and allow for the education of a wider audience. While computer assisted learning has been shown to be effective in certain areas of teaching, it is still unknown if using computer assisted learning is effective in teaching technical, hands-on skills to students.</p>
							
                            <p>In a recent study, Scotty Craig investigated the effectiveness of a computer assisted learning system known as ALEKS. The study determined that students who were taught mathematics using ALEKS and with traditional methods had almost identical scores on the math section of their state tests. A very similar study was performed using a different learning system. This time the test subjects were fourth grade students instead of high schoolers. This study also concluded that students who participated in the CAL group performed just as well as students in the traditional classroom study. Students with special needs could also benefit from specialized computer assisted learning software. Research by Robert Pennington found that students with autism can further their writing skills with the help of computer assisted learning. These studies make it clear that computer assisted learning can be effective at conveying knowledge to students and teaching subjects like mathematics and writing, but is it possible for computer assisted learning to teach practical skills to students?
</p>    
         
							<p> In 1997, a study was performed by David Rogers in order to determine the effectiveness of computer assisted learning, except in this case students were learning to tie a basic surgical knot. The study found that students who participated in the computer assisted classroom performed worse overall when asked to perform the surgical skill. The only issue with this study is that it was performed almost 20 years ago. Since then, technology and software has drastically changed and improved which could very well change the outcome of this study. If computer assisted learning was found to effectively teach students to perform practical skills, it could potentially streamline the education in dozens of different fields. Certain modern and advanced software systems that teach hand-on skills already exist, but the effectiveness of these systems is still unclear. 
</p>
							<p>A research study performed by Roumen Vesselinov and John Grego investigated the effectiveness of a foreign language learning software, Duolingo. This study concluded it to be effective and even stated that it could replace a college level spanish class. The study was funded by Duolingo itself, so the results of this study could have been biased to some extent. It is vital to ensure that there is no bias in our study into the effectiveness of teaching hands-on skills. This means that whichever company develops the software that will be used in our study would need to be economically separated from our study in order to ensure there is no bias.
</p>    
         
							<p>In order to completely study the effectiveness of CAL at teaching students practical skills, a proper software system would need to be selected. For example, many virtual lab software systems exist in order to simulate a laboratory setting and allow students to learn basic laboratory procedures. Students would need to be separated into two large groups. One group that learns how to perform a certain laboratory skill, in the typical classroom setting. The other group would need to be taught the laboratory skill using the virtual lab. After both groups have had equal time to learn the skill, each student would have to be asked to perform the task in an actual laboratory setting. Each instance should be recorded and reviewed by a group of people who have experience in performing this particular skill. Each student can then be rated by both the time required to complete the task as well as the quality of the studentsâ€™ performance. The resulting data can then be analyzed in order to determine the how effective the software was at teaching the students. This process could then repeated in different fields such as a surgical simulation or other similar applications. The results could then be compared between skills to see if they drastically differ.
</p>
							<p>Many recent research exists that proves that computer assisted learning is an effective way to teach students, but all of these studies test knowledge skills, such as mathematics or writing. Researching the effectiveness of teaching hands-on skills using computer assisted learning could open up a more efficient way to an even wider range of students. Trade skills could be taught as well as surgical skills. Previous research that studied this is very outdated and did not have nearly the same technology as we do today. Since then, virtual labs and simulations have been developed and allow us to teach practical skills. Determining the effectiveness of these systems is important to ensure that students are able to perform the skill with the same quality if taught by face to face by an instructor.
