                        <div class="content">
							<p>Computer assisted learning (CAL)  is a method of teaching that has been on the rise ever since the use of computers became widespread. It is defined as ‘any use of computers to aid or support the education or training of people’. Computer assisted learning opens the door to offer a more streamlined method to educate the masses. Current research indicates the many benefits that computer assisted learning can have versus the traditional teaching methodology. CAL is starting to become extraordinarily widespread and can be applied to many various students such as those who are still in primary school as well as students pursuing an education to become a medical doctor.</p>
							
                            <p>Over recent decades, information within the medical field has continued to expand at exponential rates. It is becoming increasingly difficult for healthcare professionals to keep up with the abundance of new information. Some argue of the effectiveness of computer assisted learning versus a traditional lecture seminar. A study by the University of Toronto Department of Surgery was performed in order to compare the two and determine which is more effective at teaching a basic surgical skill.  A group of freshman students were assigned to participate in either a one hour long computer assisted learning session or a traditional lecture seminar that included feedback from the instructor. Both of these sessions aimed to teach the students how to tie a fundamental surgical knot, the two handed square knot. Each student was then analyzed individually by surgeons and rated on the quality of their performance. The study concluded that while the average time to complete the task was almost identical in both groups, the computer assisted learning group had a significantly lower quality of performance. </p>    
         
							<p>This is a key conclusion because it shows that while CAL can be effective it does have certain limiting factors. Additionally, a significant piece of information about this study was that is was performed in 1998. Since then, technology has great progress and many new and more advanced methods of computer assisted learning have emerged. Some of the results of this study could potentially be invalidated simply because of its use of older, less advanced technology. On the other hand, even though this study was published almost 20 years ago, it is still relevant and a lot can be learned from it. It demonstrates the value of lecture seminar along with feedback from the instructor. It is important to note that the lecture seminar was paired along with personal feedback from the instructor while the students were learning the task.  Many college professors teaching large lectures do not offer the same level of feedback as the instructor did in the study. This is relevant because the study provided the students with feedback while they were learning how to tie the knot. Therefore this study would only apply to smaller classrooms in which the instructor has a higher amount of interaction with the students.</p>
							
							<p> A more modern study involving computer assisted learning tested the incorporation of a computer aided learning system known as Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces, also called ALEKS (Craig, 495). This system is an advanced adaptive piece of educational software that encompasses coursework within mathematics, chemistry as well as other subjects.  The study was funded by The Institute of Education Sciences which is a research  branch of the U.S. Department of Education. The first study was performed in order to gauge the effectiveness of ALEKS. It involved a large group of students placed into two separate after school programs and analyzed their performance on a state test. One was a teacher-led program where teachers taught the students as a class, while the other program was a slightly more independent classroom approach and was primarily led using ALEKS as the primary means of teaching.  The study then compared the students results on the state exams after several weeks in the program. According to the exam results, students in both programs had near identical performance. This goes to show that the use of ALEKS has the potential to supplement the work of the teacher in a typical classroom setting. Having a system like ALEKS that can assist in teaching students opens the door to allowing schools to select between traditional methods of teaching or using ALEKS, depending on their available resources. Unlike the previous study that was discussed, this one only involves teaching information to the students rather than a technical skill. The learning system would have to be modified in order to support teaching certain technical skills. If this was the case, it would be important to conduct further research to determine if the system would be able to adequately teach a more hands on and technical skill, such as basic surgical procedures.

							<p>Learning a foreign language can be a rewarding, but challenging task to accomplish to most. Many individuals opt to make use of a computer-aided learning system in order to teach themselves a new language. Duolingo is a relatively newly developed language learning software system that claims to ‘trump university-level language learning’. A study was performed by Dr. Roumen Vesselinov and Dr. John Grego in order to determine the potential effectiveness of the Duolingo language learning system. Although this study was funded by Duolingo, the paper claims that “the data collection and analysis were done independently by the Research team”(Vesselinov & Grego, 1). In this study, a random sample of participants were given access to the learning system and asked to use it for at least 2 hours per week for the course of 2 months. Prior to beginning using Duolingo, participants were given a spanish placement test, known as WebCAPE, and their scores were recorded.  After the 2 months, the final pool of eligible participants were given the placement test again in order to measure their improvement. The study concluded that the participant scored an average of 8 points higher for each hour of use than the first examination. According to this study, a Duolingo user could place the same as a student who has taken a full college semester of introductory Spanish. One issue with this study is that while the pool of participants were said to be random, yet 69.3% of participants in the final pool were college graduates, many of which who had a master's degree or higher. Additionally, those participants who claimed to study Spanish for business or travel reasons performed significantly better than those that marked off ‘personal interest’ as their reason. It would be difficult to compare the results of this study to a conventional university language course. Many of the students taking a language course are taking it because they are required too and may be less motivated to complete the self guide instruction when compared to research volunteers. The average age of the volunteers was 35, which deviates greatly from the age of a typical college student. This study provides us with interesting information about the effectiveness of learning a language through computer software, but it does not offer much insight on how it could be used in a school setting.

																										<p>Elementary school students have always struggled keeping the attention of young students as well as keeping them interested in the material. One application of computer assisted learning is the use of educational software in order assist with teaching young students in a fun and engaging way. One example of this sort of software, called Frizbi Mathematics 4, was studied by Olga Pilli and Meral Aksu in order to determine its effectiveness in the classroom. The study observed two groups of fourth grade students. The experimental group received computer-aided instruction using the educational software, Frizbi Mathematics 4 while the control group of students received instruction by traditional teaching methods. All students were given assessments before and after going through the entire four month program. As expected, both the control group and the experimental group performed better on the post-test. One noticeable difference between the groups was that the experimental group outperformed the traditional instruction group on the ‘multiplication and division of natural numbers’ category of the exam. Although, this trend did not hold true for the ‘fractions’ portion of the examination. This could mean that computer assisted learning in adolescents is effective in some areas, while being less effective than traditional teaching in other areas. It would be important to perform more research into which types of subjects cause certain CAL software to be inefficient.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an umbrella term that incorporates a wide range of social and learning disorders that impacts an individual's social and communication skills (Fletcher-Watson, 87).  Advancements in computer technology over the past few decades have allowed for the creation of specialized software in order to aid the education of students with learning disabilities and related disorders that an impact a student’s learning potential. In a study conducted by the University of Louisville Autism Center, Robert Pennington, the leader of the study, delves into the potential effectiveness of a computer assisted learning software in order to teach story writing to elementary school students with autism. This study used a piece of software in order to guide the participants to write very simple stories. After being instructed with the software for several weeks, all of the participants in the study showed improvement on their storytelling abilities. For example, one particular participant was only able to write stories made up of a single sentence, but by the end he was able to construct short stories usings 3 to 4 sentences. Specialized software such as this can be extraordinarily helpful to the educational development of those students who may have learning disabilities that could put them at a disadvantage in a typical classroom setting.  Despite the positive results in this particular study, it would be beneficial to investigate a wider range of participants. In this case, there were only 3 participants in the study.
</p>
<p>Computer aided learning has proven to be effective in some areas throughout a wide range of applications amongst many different types of students. It largely depends on the specific piece of software itself. Each form of computer aided learning has its shortcomings as well as its benefits. More importantly, the efficiency of computer aided learning relies heavily on the quality and the particular subject matter of the software itself. It is impossible to classify all CAL software as inherently good or bad. Each piece of software should be thoroughly investigated individually in order to determine in which areas it lack such that a teacher may be able to compensate for those areas during classroom instruction. Computer aided learning, in its current state, is unable to completely replace certain traditional teaching methods. As technology advances and software becomes more complex, it is possible that CAL could eventually outperform traditional classroom teaching methods. For now, it can best be used as a very helpful supplement to a normal classroom setting. </p>
